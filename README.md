# Predict-Future-Product-Prices-Using-Facebook-Prophet
In this project, I'm going to forecast the future prices of avocados using a time series forecasting tool called Prophet by Facebook. The prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive regression model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality plus holiday effects. Prophet implements an additive regression model with 4 elements: 
a) A priceless linear, prophet automatic picks up change point in data and identifies any change in trends. 
b) Early seasonal component modeled using the Fourier series. 
c) Weekly seasonal component. 
d) A holiday list can be provided manually. 
Speciality of this tool is that no data preproccessing is required.
