# Predict-Future-Product-Prices-Using-Facebook-Prophet
In this project I'm going to forecast the future prices of avocades using time series forecasting tool called Prophet by Facebook.
Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive regression model where non linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily sessionality plus holiday effects.
Prophet implements an additive regression model with 4 elements:
a) A priceless linear, prophet automatic picks up change point in data and identifies any change in trends.
b) Early seasonal component modelled using fourier series.
c) Weekly seasonal component.
d) A holiday list can be provided manually.
Speciality of this tool is that no data preproccessing is required.
